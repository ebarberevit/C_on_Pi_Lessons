How Functions Communicate
	1. Use parameters/arguments to pass data between them
	2. Use the return statement to pass a value back to the 
		calling function
	3. Use global variables

C Language Statements
	for loop
	while loop
	if statement
	switch statement
	return statement
	
C Language Operators
	&	 "Address of" used in scanf() function
			(but has other meaning as well)
	*	 "Pointer to"
			(but has other meaning as well)

	==	 comparison operator
	=	 assignment operator
	+	 arithmetic addition
